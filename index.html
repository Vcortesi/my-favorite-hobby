    <p>
        When I built my first PC I felt really proud of myself. I was pretty young and
        remember saving<br> up for a while to buy everything and teach myself how to put everything together.

    <ul>
        <li>How long have you been doing it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I built my first computer around 7th grade and found something I really enjoy doing every since! <br>
        So a few years. I enjoy it because I feel accomplished after setting a build up.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Why do you enjoy it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        I like building computers because I find it really interesting and like being creative  <br> with them. Building computers also introduces you to troubleshooting and problemsolving.
